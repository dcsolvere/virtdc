PYTHON PACKAGING:

Always use #!/usr/bin/env python


To make virtdc as a command,
Reference : [http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/165378/basic-steps-to-develop-python-api-in-unix-environment]
1. create another file in /usr/bin/virtdc. In this virtdc is the file name.
 (Similarly this file also can be created in /usr/local/bin. This path must be appended to $PATH. In most of the cases /usr/bin or /usr/loacl/bin is already available in $PATH)
 If /usr/bin is not available in $PATH then we have to add it.
	File content:
		#!/usr/bin/env python
		import sys
		sys.path.append('/var/lib/virtdc/com.vmplacement.framework')
		from virtdc import main

		main(sys.argv[1:])

2. There must be an empty file in '/var/lib/virtdc/com.vmplacement.framework' where virtdc.py is located. So that virtdc.py can be imported from other files.
	export PATH=$/usr/bin/:$PATH
